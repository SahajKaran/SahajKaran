# Hi there, I'm Sahaj KaranðŸ‘‹

## About
I am an energetic and ambitious third-year undergraduate student majoring in Data Science at SFU. I am passionate about anything that has to do with the interpretation of data, be it exploratory data analysis or applying AI and ML concepts. Currently, I am working on predicting house prices by combining the traditional predictor variables with the OSM (Open Street Map) data to predict house prices by amenities. Apart from that, I enjoy learning about anything and everything from technology to finance to mythology. Besides, I have interests in art, fitness, investing, and blockchain development. I plan to specialize as a data analyst or a data scientist in the finance sector, where my existing and ongoing knowledge of data and finance can make a difference. 

## What's Going On
- I'm currently looking for a CO-OP role in data analytics, data engineering, data science or business analytics
- I'm currently learning supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning models 
- 2022 Goals: 
  - Find relevant work experience
  - Get started with machine learning projects
  - Upload more on Linkedin and Github
